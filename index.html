        <h2 id="section1">User Research and Persona Creation</h2>
            <h3>User Research</h3>
                <p>To gather insights on the target users’ needs, challenges, and behaviours,
                    there are multiple strategies that I can use, each with its advantages
                    and disadvantages, as well as limitations.
                </p>
            <h3>User Needs</h3>
                <p>To gather information about the users’ needs, I will conduct a survey analysis.
                    The survey will be conducted online; there is no need to conduct an in-person survey for the
                    purpose of this application. Next, the survey will provide me with important information for
                    both the design of the app itself as well as the creation of the personas: the survey collects
                    information that helps label the target demographic of the app as well as provide a list of
                    potentially significant features to include.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, although it is not useful for this case, another possibility for collecting user data
                     is the use of case studies or collecting information through published literature. By analysing
                     already known data, it is easier to make some predictions (by using data processing techniques)
                     to get a preliminary idea of the users’ needs for certain demographics (age, region, ethnicity, etc.).
                </p>
            <h3>Challenges</h3>
                <p>Some challenges related to collecting the user needs are getting the survey to reach the most diverse
                     audience, processing the data, getting enough responses to the survey as well as having a complete survey.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is important to reach a diverse audience when conducting the survey because it is important to
                    account for any differences in culture that may affect the users’ behaviour.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Next, once the survey data is collected, processing it and getting conclusions from it is also
                    difficult; in the case of answers that are typed by users, they need to be manually processed to
                    analyse the information present. When answers are given from a choice of answers, it is easy to
                    observe the frequency of each answer, but in the case of paragraphs, the content and structure
                    may vary for each respondent, which ends up creating inconsistencies in the data’s presentation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lastly, it is important to both have enough respondents to the survey as well as a complete survey.
                    If too few respondents answer the survey, it is difficult to get an overview of popular features to
                    add. Also, if the survey is incomplete, it is more difficult to get the respondents to answer another
                     survey; it is time consuming for both the researcher and the respondents.
                </p>

            <h3>Personas</h3>
                <p>After conducting the survey, two contrasting, personas stuck out:</p>
                <ul class="personas">
                    <li>The younger, 24-year-old user</li>
                    <li>The older, 70-year-old user</li>
                </ul>

                <p>By analysing the data from the respondents, the focus of the app, for these personas, is the aspect
                    of communication with a healthcare professional, scheduling online appointments as well as their
                     reminders, and reminders and renewals of prescriptions online. There weren’t any exceptional cases
                     amongst the personas; none of the results resulted in personas that had needs that were too specific
                     or beyond the scope of this application. The first persona is a 24-year-old male who is recently
                     graduated, and the second persona is a 70-year-old retired female. This data is from the surveys,
                     and while not every respondent was a 24-year-old male or a 70-year-old female, most of the respondents
                     fell into either one of these two categories.

        <h2 id="section2">User Journey Mapping</h2>
            <p>
                Next, to showcase a few use cases, as an overview from the user’s standpoint, a user journey map is made.
                To best display the actions a user might take if they had specific problems with the application. In this
                case, both personas are the center of attention for this user journey map, but any user will find a similar
                 experience when using the app. The only differences may be in the resulting emotions, since they vary from
                 person to person. The different scenarios range from taking an appointment with a doctor, through the app,
                 using the chat feature, notifying the user to take medication and reminding the user to renew their prescriptions.
            </p>

        <h2 id="section3">Wireframes and Prototype Design</h2>
            <h3>Wireframes</h3>
                <p>These initial sketches showcase what I imagined the application would look like. Although in terms
                     of looks it is preliminary, the functionality behind each action is properly showcased by the
                     various arrows in the diagram. Each arrow points to the new screen presented to the user once
                     the corresponding option is clicked.
                </p>
                <img src="mockup.jpg" alt="Sketched Wireframe Showcasing Potential User Interactions">

            <h3>Prototypes</h3>

                <!-- Image Carousel -->
                <div class="carousel">
                    <div class="carousel-wrapper">
                        <img id="carousel-image" src="prototype/home.png" alt="User Benefit Image">
                    </div>
                </div>

                <p>This is a side-by-side of the prototype, based on the wireframe created. From the wireframe to the
                    prototype, there was an improvement made to the layout of certain features: in the appointment
                    scheduler, a new screen appears when a date is chosen. This makes the appointment scheduler less
                    cluttered.
                </p>
            <h3>Colour Palette</h3>
                <p>
                    I chose a monochromatic colour palette for the interface because it provides the user with a
                    minimalistic. Some more colour could be added as accents to highlight some key features of the
                    app: the buttons can have a light blue highlight around them to clearly indicate where the next
                    step should be. The specific choice for blue, in this example, is the “calm” nature of blue: it
                    isn’t a harsh colour like red, for example.
                </p>

                <script>
                    // Image array
                    const images = [
                    "prototype/home.png",
                    "prototype/hamburger.png",
                    "prototype/account.png",
                    "prototype/reminders.png",
                    "prototype/messages.png",
                    "prototype/medication.png",
                    "prototype/apt_date.png",
                    "prototype/apt_time-and-save.png"
                ];

                    let currentIndex = 0;
                    const imageElement = document.getElementById("carousel-image");

                    // Preload images to avoid flickering
                    images.forEach(src => {
                        const img = new Image();
                        img.src = src;
                    });

                    function changeImage() {
                        currentIndex = (currentIndex + 1) % images.length;

                        // Apply the slide-out animation
                        imageElement.style.animation = "slideOut 1.75s forwards";

                        setTimeout(() => {
                            imageElement.src = images[currentIndex];
                            // Apply the slide-in animation
                            imageElement.style.animation = "slideIn 1.75s forwards";
                        }, 500); // Matches animation duration
                    }

                    setInterval(changeImage, 4500); // Change image every 3 seconds
                </script>



        <h2 id="section4">Usability Testing</h2>
        <p>
            An example of a usability testing plan would look like the following:
            <br>
            <br>
            After a month or two of use of the application, users would receive a survey that inquires on
             their experience and how they feel about the looks of the application and how it functions.
             This part of the survey gives information regarding the user experience of the application.
             In the same survey, I will also ask about any improvements the users would like to see brought to the
             application or share any known issues they have experienced. This will help with future development of
             the application. All this data will be collected by the means of a survey that will appear as a
             prompt when opening the application.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since the survey, this time, will contain more “long” answers, there are two ways of handling this data:
            <ol>
                <li>People manually filter and label the responses.</li>
                <li>Use a machine learning model to help sort the responses into different categories: improvement,
                    customer satisfaction, overall rating.</li>
            </ol>
            <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Once the data is separated, it becomes much easier to analyze and pinpoint what are the most urgent issues
            to tackle and which issues can be addressed at a later stage.
        </p>


        <h2 id="section5">Reflection</h2>
            <h3>Identifying Needs</h3>
                <p>The user experience design process helped me identify user needs, firstly, by having a basic
                    idea of my target audience. After conducting a survey, it was easier to identify the main
                    age groups targeted by the app. Once the top demographics were identified, it was easier
                    to design an application that would most likely fulfill the needs for each. Younger demographics
                    tend to enjoy more minimalistic approaches to interfaces; they’re less busy, they don’t
                    overwhelm the user with features, and they look nice all while maintaining full functionality.
                    On the other hand, with an older demographic (generation X, or even baby boomers), a simple user
                    interface is preferred since it is less likely to confuse the user. The simple layout and design
                    are mostly intuitive and provides a smooth experience for the user.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In this case, based on the survey I conducted, I identified some extra features to include in future
                    iterations of this application.
                </p>

                <img src="survey/survey-extra-features.png" alt="Survey Response Containing Information About Additional Features">
                <br>
                <img src="survey/survey-premium.png" alt="Survey Response Containing Information About Premium Features">
                <br>
                <img src="survey/survey-long-ans.png" alt="Survey Response Containing Short Answers to Questions and Usability">
                <p>Based on the survey I conducted, on top of the features in this application, users would like to see some extra
                    features in later updates. The most requested feature is the ability for the application to send push notifications
                    to the user without needing the app to be open. This was highly requested since it doesn’t force the user to
                    constantly have the application open, instead, they can be notified or reminded at the time of the reminder
                    (instead of being reminded every time the application is opened).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Next, based on results from the survey, the next two most requested features are related to existing
                    functionalities of the application:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Alerts for refills for monthly prescriptions</li>
                    <p>In future developments, the application will inform the users, with notifications, when their
                        prescriptions are running low and will need to be refilled.
                    </p>
                    <li>Secure messaging with healthcare professionals</li>
                    <p>When the users will be interacting with the messaging part of the application, it is very important to
                        keep the communication between both parties secure, to prevent data breaches and information leaks.
                        From the initial release of this application, while secure communication is not guaranteed, the application
                        will not have the messaging feature enabled to not be enabled. This is to prevent any issues with the
                        security of users and their data.
                    </p>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Lastly, from the short-answer questions, a final future improvement would be to include the option to deliver
                    medication, either scheduled or as a one-time delivery. This would be helpful for the users who aren’t able
                    to always make their way to pick up their medication, or for the users that don’t have enough time in the
                    day to do so.
                </p>

             <h3>Challenges</h3>
                <p>
                    When designing the prototype for this app, it was clear that one of the many challenges would be to make
                    the interface intuitive, and easy-to use for all users. I can’t make the interface keeping in mind only
                    the younger users, even though they are most likely to be the people to use the application for the
                     amount of time. I can’t make the interface considering the older users either, even though they are
                     most likely to be the most frequent users. Each age group for the users has its pros and cons; younger
                     users may not be bothered by smaller text and more interactable, whereas older users may prefer a simpler
                     interface with larger text and buttons and fewer buttons (to minimize the risks of accidentally pressing
                     something).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another challenge when designing the app was to make each part of the user experience operate with as
                    little instruction as possible: I did not want to have lots of text on the page to instruct my user
                    with what the page is used for. Instead, each page the user visits is dedicated to display only a few
                    items. This, paired with the title of the page gives the user a good enough understanding of what the
                    current page is dedicated towards.
                </p>
            <h3>Improvements</h3>
                <p>For the future, to improve the application, first on the “to do” list is work with the gathered feedback
                    related to the user interface and the user experience while using the app. If there are any issues
                    with the layout of the app, they need to be resolved sooner rather than later, since a negative user
                    experience will lead to a reduced usage rate of the app, which is not good in the long term.
                </p>
